## Task: Resolve Platform Type Conflicts & Unify Definitions

**Date Started:** (Assuming current date for this entry)

**Status:** Completed

**Summary:**
Unified the `Platform` TypeScript type definition across the ClipsCommerce scheduling and deliverables features. This involved:
1.  Establishing `c:\SocialSchedule\src\app\deliverables\types\deliverables_types.ts` as the single source of truth for the `Platform` type.
2.  Updating `c:\SocialSchedule\src\app\deliverables\types\index.ts` to import and re-export the canonical `Platform` type.
3.  Refactoring `c:\SocialSchedule\src\app\deliverables\functions\engagement_predictor.ts` to:
    *   Import `Platform` directly from `deliverables_types.ts`.
    *   Replace all instances of the alias `DeliverablesPlatform` with the canonical `Platform`.
    *   Ensure type consistency in function parameters and internal logic.
4.  Refactoring `c:\SocialSchedule\src\app\deliverables\functions\optimizeSchedule.ts` to:
    *   Import `Platform` directly from `deliverables_types.ts`.
    *   Correct the import for the `Video` type (aliased as `AnalysisVideo`) to point to its actual source (`@/app/analysis/types/analysis_types`).
    *   Remove a duplicate `platform` property in the `ContentToSchedule` interface.
    *   Ensure type consistency in function parameters and internal logic.
5.  Updating type definitions within `c:\SocialSchedule\src\app\deliverables\types\deliverables_types.ts` (`EngagementPrediction`, `ScheduledPost`, `OptimizedCaption`) to use the canonical `Platform` type, resolving downstream assignability errors.
6.  Verified that type guards for events (`PostScheduledEvent`, `PostPublishedEvent`, `PostFailedEvent`) in `c:\SocialSchedule\src\app\deliverables\types\index.ts` correctly align with their respective type definitions.

**Outcome:**
All identified TypeScript errors related to `Platform` type mismatches, incorrect imports, and inconsistent type usage within the engagement prediction and schedule optimization services have been resolved. The codebase now uses a unified `Platform` type, improving type safety and maintainability.
