## Task: Implement ClipsCommerce Dashboard Shell & Accelerate UI Foundation

**Date Started:** (Current Date)
**Date Completed:** (Current Date)

**Status:** In Progress (Accelerate UI with drag-and-drop implemented, video upload and editing features pending)

**Summary:**
Began the ClipsCommerce dashboard redesign by implementing the main UI shell and the foundational structure for the "Accelerate" section, including drag-and-drop functionality. Key updates include:
1.  **Sidebar Update (`src/components/dashboard/Sidebar.tsx`):**
    *   Replaced "SocialSchedule" branding with "ClipsCommerce" name and new logo (inverted ChatGPT image).
    *   Updated navigation links to: Dashboard, Accelerate, Blitz, Cycle, Settings, with corresponding new icons (`HomeIcon`, `ZapIcon`, `CalendarDaysIcon`, `LineChartIcon`, `SettingsIcon`).
    *   Applied the new ClipsCommerce dark theme: `bg-card` background, `text-foreground`, `border-border`, `bg-primary` for active links.
    *   Updated copyright to "ClipsCommerce".
2.  **Header Update (`src/components/dashboard/Header.tsx`):**
    *   Removed redundant desktop logo (main branding now in sidebar).
    *   Applied new dark theme: `bg-card`, `border-border`, `text-foreground`.
    *   Updated notification bell and user avatar icons to use theme-appropriate colors (e.g., `bg-muted`, `text-primary`).
    *   Updated mobile menu navigation links and styling to match the new theme and sidebar structure.
3.  **Accelerate Section UI (`src/components/dashboard/AccelerateComponent.tsx`):**
    *   Completely overhauled the component to establish a Kanban-style interface for bulk video optimization.
    *   Added a page header: "Accelerate: Bulk Video Optimization" and an "Add Videos" button.
    *   Implemented a Kanban board with four columns: "To Do / Uploaded", "Processing", "Review & Edit", "Ready to Post".
    *   Included placeholder video cards within columns, displaying a thumbnail placeholder, title, status, and Edit/Delete buttons.
    *   Styled using Tailwind CSS and `shadcn/ui` components, adhering to the new dark theme.
    *   Initialized with sample data for videos and columns for layout demonstration.
    *   **Drag-and-Drop Functionality:** Integrated `@dnd-kit` to enable dragging video cards between columns. This includes:
        *   Installation of `@dnd-kit/core`, `@dnd-kit/sortable`, `@dnd-kit/utilities`.
        *   Creation of a `SortableVideoCard` component with drag handles.
        *   Setup of `DndContext`, `SortableContext`, sensors, and `DragOverlay`.
        *   Implementation of `handleDragStart` and `handleDragEnd` to update video `columnId` and reorder videos within the same column.

**Outcome:**
The dashboard's main navigation components (Sidebar and Header) now reflect the ClipsCommerce branding and new dark theme. The "Accelerate" section features an interactive Kanban board with drag-and-drop capabilities for managing video optimization workflows. Next steps include implementing video upload/selection and the detailed editing interface for video cards.

## Task: Resolve Platform Type Conflicts & Unify Definitions

**Date Started:** (Assuming current date for this entry)
**Date Completed:** (Assuming current date for this entry)

**Status:** Completed

**Summary:**
Unified the `Platform` TypeScript type definition across the ClipsCommerce scheduling and deliverables features. This involved:
1.  Establishing `c:\SocialSchedule\src\app\deliverables\types\deliverables_types.ts` as the single source of truth for the `Platform` type.
2.  Updating `c:\SocialSchedule\src\app\deliverables\types\index.ts` to import and re-export the canonical `Platform` type.
3.  Refactoring `c:\SocialSchedule\src\app\deliverables\functions\engagement_predictor.ts` to:
    *   Import `Platform` directly from `deliverables_types.ts`.
    *   Replace all instances of the alias `DeliverablesPlatform` with the canonical `Platform`.
    *   Ensure type consistency in function parameters and internal logic.
4.  Refactoring `c:\SocialSchedule\src\app\deliverables\functions\optimizeSchedule.ts` to:
    *   Import `Platform` directly from `deliverables_types.ts`.
    *   Correct the import for the `Video` type (aliased as `AnalysisVideo`) to point to its actual source (`@/app/analysis/types/analysis_types`).
    *   Remove a duplicate `platform` property in the `ContentToSchedule` interface.
    *   Ensure type consistency in function parameters and internal logic.
5.  Updating type definitions within `c:\SocialSchedule\src\app\deliverables\types\deliverables_types.ts` (`EngagementPrediction`, `ScheduledPost`, `OptimizedCaption`) to use the canonical `Platform` type, resolving downstream assignability errors.
6.  Verified that type guards for events (`PostScheduledEvent`, `PostPublishedEvent`, `PostFailedEvent`) in `c:\SocialSchedule\src\app\deliverables\types\index.ts` correctly align with their respective type definitions.

**Outcome:**
All identified TypeScript errors related to `Platform` type mismatches, incorrect imports, and inconsistent type usage within the engagement prediction and schedule optimization services have been resolved. The codebase now uses a unified `Platform` type, improving type safety and maintainability.
