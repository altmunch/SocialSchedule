# Codebase Improvement Plan - Orchestrator Agent Tasks

This document now serves as the primary task list for the Orchestrator Agent (the AI itself) to manage and oversee the entire codebase improvement process. It outlines the high-level tasks, dependencies on sub-agents (Logic, UI/UX, Testing & Bug Fixes), and direct responsibilities of the Orchestrator Agent to ensure the product becomes a production-ready, real-world solution.

## Overall Goal: Achieve Production-Readiness and Enterprise-Grade Functionality

The ultimate objective is to transform ClipsCommerce into a robust, scalable, accessible, and high-performing platform capable of handling 1000x scale operations with enterprise automation features, as per the successful team dashboard implementation (Memory ID: 5000278518631167761). All improvements will be based on the current state of the implementation, with a focus on comprehensive and detailed execution.

## Execution Phases & Orchestration

The improvement plan is broken down into three main phases, each managed by a specialized sub-agent, with cross-cutting tasks directly handled by the Orchestrator Agent. The Orchestrator Agent is responsible for:
1.  **Initiating and Monitoring Sub-Agent Progress**: Ensuring each sub-agent completes its assigned tasks from their respective roadmap files.
2.  **Handling Cross-Cutting Tasks**: Directly implementing foundational infrastructure, backend limits, SEO, and deployment preparations.
3.  **Integration and Verification**: Ensuring seamless integration between different components and verifying the overall system stability and performance.
4.  **Testing**: Ensuring all new and modified code has comprehensive tests, and that existing tests pass, running `npm test` as per Memory ID: 4172886699378608201.
5.  **Documentation and Feedback**: Updating relevant documentation and collecting feedback at key milestones.

**Next Steps for Orchestrator Agent:**
1.  Initiate Phase 1 tasks by instructing the Logic Agent to begin work on `00.workflow/logic_improvements_roadmap.md`.
2.  Continuously monitor progress across all phases.
3.  Execute Phase 4 tasks directly as they become relevant or dependencies are met.
4.  Ensure all changes are thoroughly tested by running `npm test` after each significant change.
5.  Maintain clear communication and update the user on progress.
6.  Upon completion of all tasks and verification, collect final feedback.
