# Engagement Prediction Agent – Implementation Plan

## Objectives
- **Predict and optimize engagement outcomes.**  
- **Compute a viral probability score and recommend strategies to increase it.**

## Data Inputs
1. Historical post performance metrics (views, likes, shares, comments, watch time).
2. Content metadata (captions, hashtags, length, publish time, topic).
3. Audience demographics and behaviour segments.
4. External factors (trends, seasonality, competitor activity).

## System Architecture
1. **Data Ingestion Pipeline**  
   • Connect to social platform APIs (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube).  
   • Load historical metrics from internal analytics DB.
2. **Feature Engineering Service**  
   • Temporal features (hour-of-day, day-of-week, holidays).  
   • Content embeddings (image/video with CLIP, text with BERT/T5).  
   • Engagement ratios (likes per view, comments per view).
3. **Model Training**  
   • Engagement Regression (LightGBM/XGBoost) to forecast numeric KPIs.  
   • Viral Classification (binary) using gradient boosting or shallow neural net.  
   • Hyper-parameter tuning with Optuna.
4. **Prediction Service (EngagementPredictionAgent)**  
   • REST/GraphQL endpoint: `POST /predict` returns expected engagement + viral probability.  
   • Batch scoring for scheduled reports.
5. **Strategy Engine**  
   • Simulate what-if scenarios (publish time, hashtag variations).  
   • Produce actionable recommendations ranked by impact.
6. **Evaluation & Monitoring**  
   • Regression: MAE, RMSE; Classification: ROC-AUC, PR-AUC.  
   • Drift detection & alerting.

## Implementation Phases
| Phase | Description | Deliverables |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | Data audit & collection | Data schema, ingestion scripts |
| 2 | Baseline models | Notebooks, trained models, evaluation report |
| 3 | Online service & API | Agent class, endpoints, integration tests |
| 4 | Strategy engine | Recommendation algorithms, rule configs |
| 5 | Dashboard & monitoring | Metrics dashboards, alerts setup |

## Next Steps
- [ ] Confirm data availability & access permissions.  
- [ ] Approve baseline model choices.  
- [ ] Build initial dataset & train baseline models.  
- [ ] Review evaluation metrics thresholds.  
- [ ] Integrate Agent API with reporting workflow.
