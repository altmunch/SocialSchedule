# Master Orchestrator Agent: Execution Plan for Optimization Tasks

This document outlines the plan for the MasterOrchestratorAgent to address key optimization tasks.

## Task 2: Resource Allocation

**User Requirement:** Dynamically allocate resources based on current system performance and agent needs.

**1. Current State Review:**
- The `MasterOrchestratorAgent.ts` includes `optimizeResourceAllocations`, `calculateCPUAllocation`, `calculateMemoryAllocation`, and `calculatePriority` functions.
- `systemMetrics` (reflecting system performance) are available to the agent.
- Agent needs are partially considered through `status.resourceUtilization` and `status.performance`.

**2. Analysis & Assessment:**
- The existing mechanism provides a good baseline for dynamic resource allocation.
- The link between overall `systemMetrics` (e.g., low average engagement) and how it influences resource allocation priorities could be strengthened.
- "Agent needs" could be made more explicit beyond just utilization and performance (e.g., specific resource requests for intensive tasks).

**3. Proposed Actions & Enhancements:**
- **Action:** Review `calculateCPUAllocation`, `calculateMemoryAllocation`, and `calculatePriority` in `MasterOrchestratorAgent.ts`.
- **Enhancement (If necessary):**
    - Modify allocation logic to more directly factor in key `systemMetrics`. For instance, if overall system engagement is low (a system performance indicator), agents directly contributing to improving engagement (e.g., `EngagementPredictionAgent`, `ABTestingAgent` focusing on engagement experiments) might receive higher priority or more resources.
    - Explore a mechanism for agents to signal specific, temporary high-resource needs for certain tasks (e.g., intensive model retraining or large-scale data analysis). This could be a new field in `AgentStatus` or a dedicated communication channel to the `MasterOrchestratorAgent`.
- **Execution Step:** Read `MasterOrchestratorAgent.ts` to confirm current logic. Propose specific code changes if enhancements are deemed beneficial for tighter coupling with system performance and agent needs.

## Task 3: Model Training Schedules

**User Requirement:** Prioritize model training for engagement prediction and content optimization engines.

**1. Current State Review:**
- `MasterOrchestratorAgent.ts` (in `makeMockDecision`) schedules `engagement_prediction` model training if `systemMetrics.modelAccuracy < 0.85`.
- The `trainModel` function in `MasterOrchestratorAgent.ts` is a placeholder.
- `updateModel.ts` contains `updateModel` (simple regression), `predictEngagement`, and `evaluateModel` for engagement.
- A clearly defined, traditionally trainable "content optimization model" is less evident.
    - `ContentOptimizationAgent.ts` has an `update_optimization_models` task attempting to call a non-existent `this.aiImprovementService.updateContentModels()`.
    - `nlp.ts` (`analyzeContentPerformancePatterns`) uses `featureStore.contentPerformance` to derive patterns, which informs optimization strategies but isn't a model training process in the typical sense.

**2. Analysis & Assessment:**
- Prioritization for the engagement prediction model is basic (accuracy threshold).
- The concept of "training" for "content optimization engines" needs clarification and implementation. It likely refers to updating heuristics, rules, or pattern recognition based on new data from `featureStore`.

**3. Proposed Actions & Enhancements:**
- **Action (Engagement Prediction):**
    - Refine prioritization logic in `MasterOrchestratorAgent.ts`. Instead of just model accuracy, consider:
        - Impact: If `systemMetrics.averageEngagementRate` is low or declining.
        - Data Drift: If the `featureStore` has received a significant amount of new, diverse data.
        - Recency: Schedule regular retraining even if accuracy is acceptable.
    - Implement the `trainModel` function in `MasterOrchestratorAgent.ts` to actually call `updateModel()` from `updateModel.ts` and potentially `evaluateModel()`.
- **Action (Content Optimization Engines):**
    - **Define "Training":** Clarify that "training" here means updating the knowledge base or heuristics used by `nlp.ts` functions like `analyzeContentPerformancePatterns` and other optimization logic within `ContentOptimizationAgent.ts`.
    - **Create Update Mechanism:**
        - Implement a new method in `AIImprovementService.ts`, e.g., `updateContentOptimizationPatterns()`, which would trigger recalculation/refresh of patterns using `analyzeContentPerformancePatterns` from `nlp.ts` based on the latest `featureStore` data.
        - `ContentOptimizationAgent.ts`'s `update_optimization_models` task should call this new service method.
    - **Prioritize Updates:** `MasterOrchestratorAgent.ts` should schedule/prioritize calls to this new service method based on:
        - Data Volume: Significant new data in `featureStore.contentPerformance`.
        - Performance of Suggestions: If UI feedback (via `UIAgent` or other means) indicates content optimization suggestions are becoming less effective.
        - Stale Patterns: Regular refresh of patterns.
- **Execution Steps:**
    1. Modify `MasterOrchestratorAgent.ts` to refine engagement model training prioritization and implement `trainModel`.
    2. Add `updateContentOptimizationPatterns()` to `AIImprovementService.ts` (calling `analyzeContentPerformancePatterns` from `nlp.ts`).
    3. Modify `ContentOptimizationAgent.ts` to use this new new service method.
    4. Update `MasterOrchestratorAgent.ts` to schedule/prioritize these content optimization pattern updates.

## Task 4: A/B Testing Priorities

**User Requirement:** Focus on experiments that target engagement rate improvements and viral content production.

**1. Current State Review:**
- `MasterOrchestratorAgent.ts` (`generateMockDecision`): Prioritizes A/B tests (caption, hashtag, timing) if `systemMetrics.averageEngagementRate < 0.05`.
- `ABTestingAgent.ts`: Its `prioritize_experiments` task uses "impact, feasibility, and current system objectives."
- `AIImprovementService.ts`:
    - `createABTest` takes `targetMetric` (includes 'engagementRate').
    - `generateExperimentOpportunities` can suggest tests.
- `abTesting.ts`: `Experiment`'s `targetMetric` includes 'engagementRate', 'likes', 'comments', 'shares', 'views'. "Virality" is not a direct metric.
- `feedbackLoop.ts`: `featureStore.contentPerformance.viralityScore` exists.

**2. Analysis & Assessment:**
- Targeting "engagement rate improvements" is well-supported by the `targetMetric` in experiments.
- Targeting "viral content production" is less direct. Virality metrics (`viralityScore`) exist but aren't directly integrated into A/B test target metrics. Engagement-related metrics (shares, views, overall engagement) serve as proxies.

**3. Proposed Actions & Enhancements:**
- **Action:** Review current A/B test prioritization in `MasterOrchestratorAgent.ts` and `ABTestingAgent.ts`.
- **Enhancement (Targeting Virality):**
    - `MasterOrchestratorAgent` should guide `ABTestingAgent`'s prioritization. If a system objective is to boost virality, the Orchestrator can instruct the `ABTestingAgent` to give higher priority to experiments targeting metrics highly correlated with virality (e.g., 'shares', 'views', or a composite).
    - Consider if `ExperimentResult` or `ExperimentAnalysis` in `abTesting.ts` can incorporate `viralityScore` if data collection allows tracking it per variant. This is a more involved change. For now, using proxy metrics is more feasible.
- **Enhancement (Proactive Experiment Generation):**
    - `MasterOrchestratorAgent` (or `ABTestingAgent` at its direction) should leverage `AIImprovementService.generateExperimentOpportunities()` more actively. If system metrics indicate low engagement or virality, the Orchestrator can request the service to generate A/B test ideas specifically focused on these areas.
- **Execution Steps:**
    1. Review `MasterOrchestratorAgent.ts` and `ABTestingAgent.ts` for current prioritization.
    2. Modify `MasterOrchestratorAgent.ts` (`makeOrchestrationDecision` and task generation for `ABTestingAgent`) to explicitly pass directives or weights for prioritizing experiments based on system objectives for "engagement rate" and "viral content production" (using proxy metrics for virality initially).
    3. Ensure `MasterOrchestratorAgent` or `ABTestingAgent` can trigger `AIImprovementService.generateExperimentOpportunities()` when needed.

## Task 5: Cross-Workflow Optimizations (Data Collection <-> Content Optimization)

**User Requirement:** Identify opportunities for synergy between data collection and content optimization workflows.

**1. Current State Review:**
- `MasterOrchestratorAgent.ts` (`generateCrossWorkflowOptimizations`): Has a general mechanism, but no specific example for Data Collection <-> Content Optimization.
- `DataCollectionAgent.ts`: Collects data per `CollectionStrategy`, monitors `DataQualityMetrics`, identifies `DataGap`s.
- `ContentOptimizationAgent.ts`: Uses `AIImprovementService` (which uses `nlp.ts`). `nlp.ts::analyzeContentPerformancePatterns` relies on `featureStore.contentPerformance` (populated by `feedbackLoop.ts`, which should be fed by `DataCollectionService`).

**2. Analysis & Key Synergy Points:**
- **Data Dependency:** Effectiveness of `ContentOptimizationAgent` (via `nlp.ts`) is highly dependent on the quality, recency, and relevance of data in `featureStore` provided by `DataCollectionAgent`.
- **Niche Alignment:** Coordinated niche focus between data collection and optimization is vital.
- **Feedback Loop:** Optimization outcomes should inform data collection needs. Data gaps directly harm optimization quality.

**3. Proposed Actions & Enhancements for `MasterOrchestratorAgent.ts`:**
- **Action:** Enhance `makeOrchestrationDecision` in `MasterOrchestratorAgent.ts` to implement active synergy mechanisms.
- **Mechanism 1: Task Linkage & Prioritization:**
    - If `MasterOrchestratorAgent` assigns a `ContentOptimizationAgent` task for a specific niche/platform, it should simultaneously check the status of data for that niche/platform (via `DataCollectionAgent`'s reported `DataQualityMetrics` or `DataGap`s).
    - If data is stale or gappy, `MasterOrchestratorAgent` should prioritize/trigger a `DataCollectionAgent` task (e.g., `optimize_collection` or `monitor_gaps` with high priority) for that specific niche/platform.
- **Mechanism 2: Data Gap Impact Awareness:**
    - When `DataCollectionAgent` reports critical/high severity `DataGap`s for a niche/platform, `MasterOrchestratorAgent` should inform `ContentOptimizationAgent`.
    - This might involve:
        - Temporarily deprioritizing optimization tasks for that niche if data is insufficient.
        - Adjusting expectations for the quality of optimization suggestions for that niche.
- **Mechanism 3: Optimization-Driven Data Needs (Advanced):**
    - Enable `ContentOptimizationAgent` to report specific data deficiencies or request particular types of data (e.g., "Need more examples of high-engagement short videos for Fitness niche on TikTok if current suggestions are underperforming").
        - This could be a new task type/status field for `ContentOptimizationAgent` to communicate this to `MasterOrchestratorAgent`.
    - `MasterOrchestratorAgent` then translates these requests into specific tasks for `DataCollectionAgent` (e.g., a more targeted `discover_sources` or `optimize_collection` task).
- **Execution Steps:**
    1. Modify `MasterOrchestratorAgent.ts`'s `makeOrchestrationDecision` to incorporate logic for Task Linkage.
    2. Modify `MasterOrchestratorAgent.ts` to process `DataGap` reports from `DataCollectionAgent` and use this information to modulate tasks for `ContentOptimizationAgent`.
    3. (Longer Term/If Feasible) Design and implement a communication pathway for `ContentOptimizationAgent` to report specific data needs back to `MasterOrchestratorAgent`, and for `MasterOrchestratorAgent` to task `DataCollectionAgent` accordingly. Start by defining the information structure.
