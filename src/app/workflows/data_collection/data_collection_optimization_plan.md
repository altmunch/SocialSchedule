# Data Collection Optimization Plan for DataCollectionOptimizationAgent

## 1. Optimize Data Collection Strategies

**Objective:** Ensure a minimum of 10,000 samples per niche per platform and maintain a data quality score above 95%.

### 1.1. Definitions
*   **Platform:** TikTok and Instagram.
*   **Niche:** User-defined categories (e.g., 'comedy skits', 'DIY crafts', 'tech reviews').
*   **Samples:** Individual pieces of content (videos, posts) collected.

### 1.2. Data Quantity Targets
*   Collect at least 10,000 samples per defined niche on each platform (TikTok, Instagram).
*   Implement robust counting and categorization mechanisms to track progress towards these targets.

### 1.3. Data Quality Metrics
*   Achieve and maintain a data quality score consistently above 95%.
*   The quality score will be a composite metric based on:
    *   **Completeness of Metadata:** Ensuring all critical metadata fields are present (e.g., content URL, uploader/creator information, caption, full engagement statistics like views, likes, comments, shares, saves).
    *   **Relevance to Niche:** Employ a classification model to assess if the collected sample accurately belongs to the designated niche.
    *   **Recency of Data:** Prioritize recently published content to ensure data freshness and relevance.

### 1.4. Data Quality Assurance
*   **Automated Checks:** Implement automated validation checks during the data collection process:
    *   Validate URLs to ensure they are active and correct.
    *   Check for missing critical metadata fields.
*   **Periodic Manual Review:** Conduct regular manual reviews of a statistically significant subset of collected samples to verify quality and identify potential issues not caught by automated checks.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Establish a continuous feedback loop to refine collection parameters, niche definitions, and classification models based on the outcomes of quality checks and manual reviews.

## 2. API Optimization Parameters

**Objective:** Optimize API rate limit usage for TikTok and Instagram data collection to ensure sustainable and efficient data gathering.

### 2.1. Monitor API Usage
*   Implement real-time monitoring of all API calls made to TikTok and Instagram.
*   Track the number of requests per specific endpoint.
*   Monitor overall API usage against the official rate limits provided by each platform.

### 2.2. Dynamic Rate Limit Management
*   Develop a system to dynamically adjust the frequency of API requests based on:
    *   Current API usage levels.
    *   Remaining quota within the current rate limit window.
*   Implement logic to prioritize the collection of essential data points if API limits are being approached, temporarily deferring less critical data.

### 2.3. Batch Requests
*   Where supported by the TikTok and Instagram APIs, batch multiple queries or data requests into single API calls to reduce the total number of requests and improve efficiency.

### 2.4. Retry Mechanisms
*   Implement robust retry mechanisms with exponential backoff strategies for handling:
    *   Temporary API errors (e.g., server-side issues).
    *   Rate limit exceeded responses.
*   Ensure that failed requests are retried in a way that respects API limits and avoids overwhelming the platform services, while preventing data loss.

## 3. Content Discovery Strategies

**Objective:** Identify high-value data sources and focus on trending hashtags and viral content patterns to maximize the relevance and impact of collected data.

### 3.1. Identify High-Value Data Sources
*   Analyze existing successfully collected content within defined niches to identify common characteristics of high-value sources (e.g., specific influential creators, types of accounts that consistently produce relevant content).
*   Actively explore and leverage platform-specific content discovery features, such as algorithms powering TikTok's 'For You' page and Instagram's 'Explore' page, to find new and relevant sources.

### 3.2. Implement Trending Hashtag Identification
*   Develop a system to continuously monitor and identify trending hashtags on TikTok and Instagram that are relevant to the defined niches.
*   Utilize platform APIs if they provide endpoints for trending topics or hashtags.
*   Alternatively, periodically scrape and analyze content from top posts and popular content within niches to identify emerging trends and popular hashtags.

### 3.3. Analyze Viral Content Patterns
*   Develop analytical methods to identify and understand the characteristics of viral content. This includes:
    *   Commonly used audio tracks or sounds.
    *   Prevalent video styles and editing techniques.
    *   Participation in current challenges or trends.
    *   Engagement velocity (e.g., rapid increase in likes, comments, shares shortly after posting).
*   Use these insights to inform the data collection process, prioritizing content that exhibits characteristics associated with higher viral potential.

### 3.4. Dynamic Source Adaptation
*   Design the system to be adaptive, allowing it to dynamically adjust its focus on different data sources, hashtags, and content patterns.
*   This adaptation should be based on their current performance, relevance to niches, and ability to yield high-quality, valuable data.
*   Regularly evaluate and update the list of prioritized sources and discovery parameters to ensure the collected data remains fresh, relevant, and impactful.
