     - Description: Briefly explain how the platform helps e-commerce sellers automate and optimize their social content for sales.
     - CTA: Button labeled 'Get Started' linking to /dashboard
  2. **Short-form Content Marketing**
     - Heading: 'Short-form Content Marketing'
     - Description: Explain how the platform helps creators/agencies with short-form content marketing, automation, and analytics.
     - CTA: Button labeled 'Get Started' linking to /dashboard
- Remove all other dropdown items from navigation.
