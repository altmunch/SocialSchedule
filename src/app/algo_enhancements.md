Below is a consolidated technical review and upgrade roadmap that spans every algorithm-bearing module in the repository.  It is organized in four layers:

1. Summary of key inadequacies (per area)  
2. Upgrade goals â€“ what "more sophisticated" means for each area  
3. Task tree (tasks âžœ sub-tasks âžœ deliverables) that will get us there, with explicit data-hand-off points between modules  
4. Execution protocol â€“ how we will run, test on real-world data (via Context-7), iterate, and finally request your feedback.

1. Major inadequacies observed
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
A. Data-Collection layer  
   â€¢ Multiple platform clients (TikTok/Instagram/YouTube) re-implement rate-limit handling, retries, and caching differently â†’ inconsistent behaviour & code duplication.  
   â€¢ Circuit-breaker logic (EnhancedScannerService) is hand-rolled; lacks half-open "probe" requests and proper exponential back-off.  
   â€¢ Token refresh logic is scattered; missing unified telemetry on refresh failures.  

B. Data-Analysis layer  
   â€¢ EngagementPredictionEngine and ModelTrainingService rely on extremely simple linear models ("SimpleMLModel").  No feature normalisation, no train/val split handling, no hyper-parameter search.  
   â€¢ FeatureEngineeringService embeds text with a cache but doesn't persist embeddings; cannot re-use across sessions.  
   â€¢ SentimentAnalysisEngine (video_optimization) uses OpenAI completions with no batching or rate-limit awareness.  

C. Optimisation/Improvement layer  
   â€¢ AIImprovementService's heuristic scoring (captionScore, hashtagScore...) is hard-coded constants â†’ fragile.  
   â€¢ ABTesting pipeline does a two-sample t-test only; no multiple-variant support, no Bayesian alternative, no sequential testing.  
   â€¢ ContentOptimizationAgent picks variation candidates blindly; no multi-armed bandit to learn across time.  

D. Orchestration / Master agent layer  
   â€¢ MasterOrchestratorAgent decides resource allocation with simple rule-based functions (calculateCPUAllocation etc.); no feedback loop from actual utilisation.  
   â€¢ No provenance/trace IDs propagated end-to-end for debugging data flow.  

â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
2. Upgrade goals
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
G1. Unify infrastructure concerns (rate-limits, retries, token refresh, tracing) behind shared utilities.  
G2. Replace simplistic statistical / ML methods with modern counterparts:  
    â€¢ Tree-based regressors for engagement prediction (LightGBM or XGBoost)  
    â€¢ Bayesian AB-tests or Thompson sampling for multi-variant optimisation  
G3. Persist reusable artefacts (embeddings, cached API responses, model files) to Redis/Postgres.  
G4. Add robust schema validation (zod) at every inter-module boundary; publish TypeScript type definitions.  
G5. Introduce system-wide tracing & metrics propagation (OpenTelemetry).  
G6. Establish CI pipeline with synthetic + real-world validation datasets; minimum performance bars.

Step 1 (you & me): Approve or adjust the roadmap above.  
Step 2 (me): Implement T0/T1 in a dedicated branch; open PR with unit tests.  
Step 3 (me): Call Context-7 library resolver to pull docs for chosen ML libraries (LightGBM-JS, Bayesian-AB-Test).  
Step 4 (me): Integrate, train on sample real-world datasets, push artefacts, and run KPI tests.  
Step 5 (me): Iterate through T2â€“T7, each in its own PR, gating on KPI improvements.  
Step 6 (me): After all tasks pass KPIs, trigger a summary report & ask for your feedback (Step 8).
