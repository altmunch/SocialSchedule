## Detailed Guide: Where to Use Each Colour on Your SaaS Landing Page for Sellers

This guide draws on SaaS landing page best practices and color psychology to maximize clarity, conversion, and appeal to your seller audience[1][2][4][7][8].

---

### **1. Primary Blue (#1E90FF or #007BFF)**
**Use For:**
- **Main CTAs:** Primary buttons like “Start Free Trial,” “Get Started,” or “Book a Demo”[2][7][8].
- **Navigation Bar:** Top navigation background or active menu highlights for a trustworthy, professional feel.
- **Section Headers:** Headings in hero and key value sections to anchor the user’s eye.
- **Links:** Hyperlinks and important in-line actions.

**Why:** Blue builds trust and reliability, making it perfect for high-importance actions and navigation[4][5].

---

### **2. Secondary Orange (#FF6F00 or #FF7F50)**
**Use For:**
- **Accent CTAs:** Secondary buttons (e.g., “Learn More,” “See a Demo”) or limited-time offers to create urgency[1][4].
- **Attention Highlights:** Badges, “New” tags, or feature callouts within sections.
- **Hover/Active States:** Button and link hover effects for a dynamic, energetic feel.

**Why:** Orange grabs attention and motivates action, ideal for drawing the eye to key opportunities without overwhelming the primary blue[1][4].

---

### **3. Clean White (#FFFFFF)**
**Use For:**
- **Background:** Main page background for a clean, modern look and maximum readability[3][6].
- **Content Areas:** Cards, forms, and testimonial sections to separate content and improve scannability[5][6].
- **Whitespace:** Generous padding and margins between sections for a clear, uncluttered layout[7].

**Why:** White space increases clarity, reduces cognitive load, and helps other colors pop[3][6][7].

---

### **4. Dark Charcoal Gray (#333333 or #444444)**
**Use For:**
- **Body Text:** Main paragraph and supporting text for optimal readability against white backgrounds[5].
- **Subheadings:** Secondary headers and less prominent titles.
- **Footer & Legal:** Footer background or text, privacy policy, and terms links.

**Why:** Charcoal gray is easier on the eyes than black, keeps the design modern, and maintains professionalism[5].

---

### **5. Accent Green (#28A745)**
**Use For:**
- **Success Indicators:** Confirmation messages, checkmarks, or “Sales Up” badges.
- **Positive Analytics:** Growth metrics, graphs, or percentage increases in dashboards.
- **Micro-Accents:** Small icons, toggle switches, or highlights that reinforce positive outcomes.

**Why:** Green signals growth and success, reinforcing your value as a sales-boosting tool[4][5].

| Section                | Background | Headings/CTAs      | Accents/Highlights         | Text                |
|------------------------|------------|--------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|

| Pricing                | White      | Blue CTA           | Orange “Best Value” badge  | Charcoal gray       |
| Footer                 | Charcoal   | Blue links         | Green icons (if needed)    | White               |

## **Key Tips**

- **CTAs should always stand out:** Use your primary blue for main actions and secondary orange for urgency or secondary actions[2][7][8].
- **Use color to create visual hierarchy:** Section backgrounds or colored headers help users scan and understand your offer quickly[3][5][6].
- **Keep the palette focused:** Limit to these 4–5 colors for a cohesive, professional look that doesn’t overwhelm[5][7].
- **Test for accessibility:** Ensure sufficient contrast between text and backgrounds for readability and inclusivity[6].
