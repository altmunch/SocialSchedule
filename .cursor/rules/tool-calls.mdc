# Agent Tool Call Utilization Workflow

## Tool Call Monitoring
After completing any batch of work, check the number of tool calls used in the current session.

## Continuous Processing
If fewer than 25 tool calls have been used:
- Immediately proceed to the next logical batch, task, or improvement.
- Do not pause or wait for further user input.

## Loop Condition
Repeat the process until:
- All 25 tool calls have been used, or
- There are absolutely no further improvements possible.

## Proactive Optimization
If all planned batches are complete and tool calls remain:
- Proactively suggest or implement additional optimizations, refactors, or tests.

## Session Completion
Only stop or prompt the user for new instructions once all 25 tool calls have been fully utilized in the session.

## General Batching Principles
- Group similar tasks together to minimize overhead and improve efficiency.
- Batch operations that affect related files or directories to reduce redundant processing.
- Ensure each batch is logically cohesive and easy to debug or roll back if needed.
- Limit batch size to avoid overwhelming the system and to simplify error handling.
- Document the purpose and scope of each batch for future reference and maintainability.

## Error Handling and Logging
- Validate all inputs before executing batch operations.
- Log the outcome of each batch, including successes and failures.
- Implement error handling to stop or roll back the batch if a critical error occurs.

## Safe Execution
- Test batch operations in a non-production environment before deploying.
- Use confirmation prompts or dry-run options for destructive actions when possible.
- Always back up important data before running batch deletions or modifications.

## PowerShell-Specific Batching
- Use full paths for files and directories in PowerShell commands to avoid ambiguity.
- Prefer cmdlets like Remove-Item, New-Item, and New-Item -ItemType Directory for file and directory operations.
- Leverage PowerShell's pipeline and filtering capabilities to efficiently select and process multiple items.
- Use functions or scripts to encapsulate batch logic for reuse and clarity.

## Batching Deletion, File, and Directory Creation (PowerShell)
- Always batch deletions and creations together when they target related files or directories through terminal command execution
- Use PowerShell terminal commands to execute these batches, for example:
  - To delete multiple files:

    powershell
    ''' 
     Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\Target\Path" -Filter "*.tmp" | Remove-Item -Force
    '''
  - To create multiple directories:

    powershell
    '''
    "DirA","DirB","DirC" | ForEach-Object { New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "C:\Target\Path\$_" }
    '''

- For combined operations, script the sequence to ensure deletions occur before creations if they share paths.

- Always verify the result of deletion and creation commands before proceeding to the next batch.

- Avoid mixing unrelated deletion and creation tasks in the same batch to reduce risk of accidental data loss.

## Review and Optimization
- Regularly review batch scripts for opportunities to further consolidate or optimize operations.
- Refactor large or complex batches into smaller, manageable functions where appropriate.

- Schedule batch jobs during off-peak hours to minimize impact on system performance.

## End of response
At the end of each response, after you have exhausted all of the steps that you have decided on or you are unsure of next steps, state the number of tool calls remaining(25 - number of tool calls used), then call the mcp-feedback-collector tool
