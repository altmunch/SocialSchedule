Deploy multiple Sub Agents to generate iterations in parallel for maximum efficiency and creative diversity:

**Agent Assignment Protocol:**
Each Sub Agent receives:
1. **Spec Context:** Complete specification file analysis
2. **Directory Snapshot:** Current state of `output_dir` at launch time
3. **Iteration Assignment:** Specific iteration number (starting_number + agent_index)
4. **Uniqueness Directive:** Explicit instruction to avoid duplicating concepts from existing iterations
5. **Quality Standards:** Detailed requirements from the specification

**Agent Task Specification:**
TASK: Generate iteration [NUMBER] for [SPEC_FILE] in [OUTPUT_DIR]

You are Sub Agent [X] generating iteration [NUMBER].

CONTEXT:
- Specification: [Full spec analysis]
- Existing iterations: [Summary of current output_dir contents]
- Your iteration number: [NUMBER]
- Assigned creative direction: [Specific innovation dimension to explore]

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Read and understand the specification completely
2. Analyze existing iterations to ensure your output is unique
3. Generate content following the spec format exactly
4. Focus on [assigned innovation dimension] while maintaining spec compliance
5. Create file with exact name pattern specified
6. Ensure your iteration adds genuine value and novelty


DELIVERABLE: files as specified, with unique innovative content
